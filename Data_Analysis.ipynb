In this report, the data is already given however, findings and discussions are not pre-established but are developed after the analysis of the data by the researcher.\n",

Examples are the graphs and charts seen in section 7.0 (analysis of Boston Savian Hill) of this report.\n",

This implies that the number of rooms in a property located in Boston Hill has little significance in the price estimation.

        "**3.1    Parameters:** This refers to the properties of each town on which property price is either dependent or not. These parameters are number of rooms, age of property, tax per year, number of pupils per tutor and distance from nearest town centre.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3.2   Estate Agent :** According to Attieku(2009), an estate agent is an individual or organisation that arranges the selling, renting, or management of properties and other buildings.\n",

        "**3.3 Normal Distribution :** A normal distribution of data is one in which the majority of data points are relatively similar, meaning they occur within a small range of values with fewer outliers on the high and low ends of the data range.\n",

It also refers to the probability that a population parameter will fall between a set of values for a certain proportion of times.\n",

On the other hand, a sample is the specific group from the population that data is generated from. The size of the sample is always less than the total size of the population.\n"
